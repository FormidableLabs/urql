# `urql` Outside of React

While you'll get the best experience with `urql` in a React codebase, it's still possible to use parts of `urql`'s functionality outside of React. In this guide, we'll take a look at using `urql` in environments other than React, including NodeJS and Vue.

The most useful element for using `urql` outside of React is the `client`, the library's central orchestrator. The `client` handles all outgoing requests and incoming responses in `urql`, and comes along with a variety of methods to help you orchestrate communication with your GraphQL API. The most useful of these are the `execute*` methods (`executeQuery`, `executeMutation`, and `executeSubscription`).

The `execute*` methods all accept an instance of a `GraphQLRequest`, which can be created by using `urql`'s `createRequest` function. `createRequest` will create a unique hash used to identify the GraphQL operation, which is used internally to track it for things like deduplication and caching.

```javascript
// load dependencies
const { createClient, createRequest } = require('urql');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

// create the urql client
const client = createClient({
  url: 'https://graphbrainz.herokuapp.com/graphql',
});

// define your GraphQL query
const query = gql`
  query SearchArtist($search: String!) {
    search {
      artists(query: $search, first: 1) {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            country
            releases(first: 10) {
              edges {
                node {
                  title
                  date
                  media {
                    format
                    trackCount
                    tracks {
                      title
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

// create the urql request object
const request = createRequest(query, { search: 'Courtney Barnett' });
```

Once you've created your request, all that's left is to execute it! When you execute a query, mutation, or subscription, `urql` returns you [a `wonka` Source](https://wonka.kitten.sh/api/sources) containing the `data` and `error` states of that request. You can use [`wonka`'s Sinks](https://wonka.kitten.sh/api/sinks) to access these like so:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const { pipe, subscribe } = require('wonka');

http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    pipe(
      client.executeQuery(request),
      subscribe(({ data, error }) => {
        if (error) {
          console.log('Error', error);
        }

        res.write(JSON.stringify(data));
        res.end();
      })
    );
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

Awesome, we've successfully executed a GraphQL query on the server in NodeJS! In practice, this is more useful for writing small Node scripts or a simple CLI for interacting with a GraphQL API. But it does show off the flexibility that `urql`'s `client` gives us!

See the full CodeSandbox example [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/urql-node-1jhj8).

## Doing More with the Client

The `client` comes with more methods than just the `execute*` methods. While the use cases for these additional methods are fairly specific to `urql`'s implementation, they do give you more direct control over the `client`. Let's say, for example, that you want to reexecute an operation on a predefined interval (a form of long polling). This is fairly trivial to do by calling `client.reexecuteOperation` with the request's `Operation` object. To create the `Operation` object, use `client.createOperation`, passing the operation type as the first argument (`"query"`, `"mutation"`, `"subscription"`, or `"teardown"`).

```javascript
require('isomorphic-fetch');
const http = require('http');
const { createClient, createRequest } = require('urql');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');
const { pipe, subscribe, interval, take } = require('wonka');

const client = createClient({
  url: 'https://graphbrainz.herokuapp.com/graphql',
});

const query = gql`
  query SearchArtist($search: String!) {
    search {
      artists(query: $search, first: 1) {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            country
            releases(first: 10) {
              edges {
                node {
                  title
                  date
                  media {
                    format
                    trackCount
                    tracks {
                      title
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

const request = createRequest(query, { search: 'Courtney Barnett' });

http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    pipe(
      client.executeQuery(request),
      subscribe(({ data, error }) => {
        if (error) {
          console.log('Error', error);
        }

        console.log('Data', data);
        res.write(JSON.stringify(data));
      })
    );

    pipe(
      interval(2000),
      take(10),
      subscribe(n => {
        // Call client.createRequest operation to create the Operation object.
        // The optional third argument is a partial operation context, which allows you
        // to change the operation's request policy or fetch options.
        const operation = client.createRequestOperation('query', request, {
          requestPolicy: 'network-only',
        });

        // Reexecute the operation. Active subscribers will receive updates.
        client.reexecuteOperation(operation);

        if (n === 9) {
          res.end();
        }
      })
    );
  })
  .listen(8080); //the server object listens on port 8080
```

Awesome, we've got basic long polling working, where our `client` is reexecuting the initial request every 2 seconds. By passing `{ requestPolicy: 'network-only' }` as the third argument to `reexecuteOperation`, we ensure that the `client` issues a new request to the GraphQL API every time rather than pulling results from the cache. You'll notice in this example we use `wonka`'s `take` operator to limit the number of times we call `reexecuteOperation` â€“ in true long polling, you wouldn't do this.

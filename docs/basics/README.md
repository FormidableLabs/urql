# Basics

In this chapter we'll explain the basics of `urql` and how to get started with using it without any
prior knowledge. It's split into multiple pages that are best read in order.

- [**React/Preact**](./react-preact.md) covers how to work with the bindings for React/Preact.
- [**Vue**](./vue.md) covers how to work with the bindings for Vue 3.
- [**Svelte**](./Svelte.md) covers how to work with the bindings for Svelte.
- [**Node**](./Node.md) covers how to work with the core-bindings.
- [**Document Caching**](./document-caching.md) explains the default cache mechanism of `urql`, as opposed to the opt-in
  [Normalized Cache](../graphcache/normalized-caching.md).
- [**Errors**](./errors.md) contains information on error handling in `urql`.

After reading "Basics" you may want to [read the "Concepts" chapter of the
documentation](../concepts/README.md) as it explains the motivation and architecture that drives
`urql`.

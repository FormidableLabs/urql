# @urql/storybook-addon

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- - Add `@urql/devtools` to `@urql/storybook-addon`. Previously it was not included (See [#1092](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/issues/1092)), but now the exchange works out of the box with Storybook, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [`7364d93`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/commit/7364d93a59186d710f0c954e1874fec96892e1c6))

## 1.0.3

## React

This shows how to use URQL in the browser with React.

A page displays a to-do list, and you can add items or mark them as complete.

(Behind the scenes, we use a browser service worker to pretend to be a GraphQL server. This is done to avoid setting up a real GraphQL server for the example.)

## Usage

#### 1. Navigate to the example directory and install dependencies

```bash
cd packages/react-urql/examples/1-getting-started
yarn
```

#### 2. Start server

```bash
yarn start
```

#### 3. Open your browser

Navigate to example at [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

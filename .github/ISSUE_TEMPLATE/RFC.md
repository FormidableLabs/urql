<!--
  ðŸš¨ RFCs are for proposed changes (not bugs or questions)
  Specifically they are whenever you'd like to see new features
  being added to urql, or enable new use-cases.
  They're also relevant whenever @urql/core is changed, since
  changes to e.g. the `Client` or `Exchange` types are kept rare
  and lean.
-->

## Summary

<!--
  Describe in a couple of words WHAT you're proposing.
  If relevant, include WHY this should be addressed now.
  The problem should be clearly stated and the solution
  should be summarised.
-->

## Proposed Solution

<!--
  Explain the solution you're proposing in detail.
  HOW will this change be implemented?
  HOW does it work?
-->

## Requirements

<!--
  This section is OPTIONAL.
  But if your proposed solution has multiple ways
  of being implemented, you don't want to state how
  it may be implemented, or you don't know yet how
  it will be implemented, then:
  List what the implementation needs to do at the very least.
